    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
    #   user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
    #   if user.admin?
    #     can :manage, :all
    #   else

      User can only access his own bokmark and own sites  
    ''' 
    return unless user.present?  # additional permissions for logged in users (they can read their own posts)
    can :manage, Bokmark, user: user

    return unless user.present?  # additional permissions for logged in users (they can read their own posts)

      user.sites.uniq.include?(site)
    end

    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
